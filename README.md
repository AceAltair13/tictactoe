## Tic Tac Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in Python using the `Pygame` library.

## Project Structure

- `runner.py`: This is the main script that runs the game. It handles the game loop, user input, and rendering the game state to the screen.
- `tictactoe.py`: This script contains the logic for the Tic Tac Toe game, including determining the current player, identifying winners, and implementing the minimax algorithm for the AI player.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the game to run.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the game by executing `python runner.py`.

Enjoy the game!
